# Fable: Where Stories Come Alive in OCaml

> "Once upon a time, there was a language that made storytelling magical..."

Welcome to Fable, where we're turning the art of storytelling into a functional programming adventure! This isn't your grandma's choose-your-own-adventure book (though she might enjoy it too). We're building a domain-specific language that lets you craft interactive narratives using the elegance of OCaml.

## What's the Magic?

Fable is like having a magical quill that writes stories with type safety. It's where functional programming meets narrative design, and where your imagination meets OCaml's powerful type system. Think of it as "Twine meets Haskell" but with OCaml's pattern matching magic.

### Features That Make Storytellers Smile

- **Branching Narratives**: Create complex story trees that would make a weeping willow jealous
- **Dynamic Characters**: Give your characters traits that evolve as the story unfolds
- **World Building**: Define locations with behaviors that respond to player choices
- **Type-Safe Storytelling**: Let OCaml's type system catch your plot holes before your readers do

## Quick Start

```ocaml
(* A simple story about a brave adventurer *)
let story =
  seq [
    say "You wake up in a dark cave, the air thick with mystery.";
    choice [
      ("Light your torch", fun () -> 
        seq [
          say "The flickering light reveals ancient runes on the wall.";
          choice [
            ("Study the runes", study_runes);
            ("Continue deeper", explore_cave);
          ]
        ]);
      ("Feel your way in the dark", fun () ->
        say "Your hands touch something cold and metallic...");
    ]
  ]
```

## Why Fable?

Because sometimes you want to write stories that are as elegant as your code. Fable brings together:

- The expressiveness of functional programming
- The power of algebraic data types
- The beauty of pattern matching
- The joy of interactive storytelling

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocaml-fable.git

# Build the project
dune build

# Run the example story
dune exec fable examples/hello_world.ml
```

## Project Goals

- Create an intuitive DSL for narrative design
- Explore the intersection of computational logic and storytelling
- Build a bridge between game narrative modeling and functional programming
- Make storytelling in OCaml as natural as writing prose
